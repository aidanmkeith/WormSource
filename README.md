# WormSource
A compendium of field-based earthworm data sources and associated meta-data.

- This contains sources from the United Kingdom and Ireland. 
- Currently, there are 257 potential data sources*, compiled through literature searches on Web of Science and Google Scholar, as well as directly from original authors/data holders where possible. 
- These were compiled up to 2021 (the earliest dates back to 1891). 
- Source meta-data covers the type of quantitative earthworm data (i.e. incidence, abundance, biomass, taxa), methodological details (e.g. sampling method/s, location/s, whether sampled plots were natural or experimental, sampling year/s), and environmental information (e.g. habitat/land-use,inclusion of climate data and basic soil properties). 
- The data sources were compiled with the aim of gathering quantitative data on earthworm species and populations to develop earthworm abundance and niche models, and toward a modelling framework for earthworm impacts on soil processes. 
- This work is part of the Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics (SOC-D) project funded by the NERC UK-SCAPE programme (Grant reference NE/R016429/1).

*This compendium has not been generated by an exhaustive search and more potential data sources will be added as identified.
