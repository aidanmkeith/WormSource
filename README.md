# WormSource
A compendium of earthworm data sources and associated information

- The initial WormSource compendium contains 257 potential data sources from the United Kingdom and Ireland (1) 
- Currently, there are still 257 potential data sources but more will be added over time (2)
- These were compiled through literature searches on Web of Science and Google Scholar, as well as directly from original authors/data holders where possible
- These were compiled up to 2021 (the earliest dates back to 1891) 
- Source meta-data covers the type of quantitative earthworm data (i.e. incidence, abundance, biomass, taxa), methodological details (e.g. sampling method/s, location/s, whether sampled plots were natural or experimental, sampling year/s), and environmental information (e.g. habitat/land-use,inclusion of climate data and basic soil properties) 
- The data sources were compiled with the aim of gathering quantitative field-based data on earthworm species and populations to develop earthworm abundance and niche models, and toward a modelling framework for earthworm impacts on soil processes
- This work is part of the Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics (SOC-D) project funded by the NERC UK-SCAPE programme (Grant reference NE/R016429/1)

(2) The initial compendium was not generated by an exhaustive search, we are already aware of numerous additional potential data sources and more will be added as identified. 

We encourage researchers and interested parties to send details of data sources that are not included in the compendium (aidan.keith@ceh.ac.uk)
